# Select the nodes
# Can be from a file or only aiming at one rack for example:
# $(cat server-list.txt | grep '10.10.50')
some_cassandra_node=localhost # Used to grep all the other nodes IPs
node_list=$(ssh $some_cassandra_node nodetool status | awk '{split($0,a," "); print a[2]}'| grep -E '[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}')

# The command to run on the previouslyy selected nodes
# Can be passed as the only argument
